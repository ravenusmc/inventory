# Inventory
## Intro

This is a simple project that will be an inventory system of tracking items in my
house hold. Its main purpose is to give me some experience working with Mongo DB and
Python together. I will also be using a little bit of bcrypt which is the first
time I have used it for any Python project. However, I will stress, that security
is not my focus on this project. I just want to see how bcrypt works and if I can
use it with Mongo DB.

What this project is able to do: Create users, let users log in, track the amount
of toilet paper in my house. Search for toilet paper levels using greater than
or less than with Mongo DB. Updating records. Again, simple project making an
inventory tracking system of toilet paper levels.

One thing that I did not do in this project was make my classes private. Something
that I could easily take up and fix at another time.
